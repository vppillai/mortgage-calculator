# Mortgage Calculator Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Mathematical Accuracy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All mortgage calculations MUST be mathematically precise and verified against known 
industry standards. Financial formulas must be documented with sources, tested with 
verified scenarios, and validated against regulatory requirements. Rounding errors, 
precision loss, or approximation methods are prohibited in core calculations.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. 
Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. All calculations require comprehensive 
test coverage including edge cases, boundary conditions, and cross-validation against 
known mortgage calculation results.

### III. User Experience Clarity
All calculations and results must be presented in clear, tabular formats with minimal 
verbose text. Users must be able to verify calculations independently. Error messages 
must be actionable and educational. Complex financial concepts must be explained in 
plain language with intuitive interface design.

### IV. Responsive Design & Accessibility
The static page MUST be fully responsive and mobile-friendly. Support both dark mode 
and light mode with proper contrast ratios. All interfaces must be accessible to users 
with disabilities, support keyboard navigation, and work across all device sizes.

### V. Comparison & Analysis Features
Users MUST be able to add multiple mortgage options to comparison tables. The system 
must clearly show total cost differences, payment schedules, and amortization periods. 
Reverse calculations must be supported to find payment methods for specific amounts 
or timeframes.

## Static Page Requirements

### Technology Standards
- Pure static HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no server-side dependencies)
- Compatible with GitHub Pages hosting
- Progressive Web App capabilities for offline use
- Modern browser support (ES6+, CSS Grid/Flexbox)
- No external dependencies that could break or compromise security

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time under 2 seconds on 3G connections
- Smooth animations and transitions (60fps)
- Efficient calculation engine with minimal memory footprint
- Lazy loading for large amortization tables
- Optimized assets and minified code for production

## User Experience Standards

### Interface Design
- Intuitive input forms with real-time validation
- Clear comparison tables with sortable columns
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Consistent dark/light mode theming
- Progressive disclosure of advanced options

### Calculation Features
- Standard mortgage payment calculations
- Pre-payment scenario modeling
- Reverse calculations (payment amount → loan terms)
- Amortization period optimization
- Multiple payment frequency options
- Tax and insurance integration

## CI/CD Pipeline Standards

### Testing Requirements
- Automated unit tests for all calculation functions
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile device testing (iOS, Android)
- Performance testing and monitoring
- Accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

### Deployment Process
- GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Automated deployment to GitHub Pages on main branch
- Pre-deployment validation of all calculations
- Rollback capability for failed deployments
- Environment-specific configuration management

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Gates
- All code must pass automated testing before merge
- Financial calculation code requires peer review
- Documentation must be updated for any calculation changes
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained
- Accessibility compliance must be verified

### Release Process
- All releases must include comprehensive testing documentation
- Mathematical accuracy validation must be completed
- User acceptance testing required for UI changes
- Cross-browser compatibility verification
- Mobile responsiveness validation

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and must be followed 
by all contributors. Amendments require documentation of the change rationale, 
impact assessment, and approval from project maintainers. All pull requests and 
reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified 
with clear user value. Use project documentation for runtime development guidance.
