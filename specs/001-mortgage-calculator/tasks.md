# Tasks: Canadian Mortgage Calculator Static Page App

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-mortgage-calculator/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests included as FR-014 explicitly requires comprehensive test coverage.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel if multiple developers available
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on at least User Story 1-3 being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories - true MVP
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Builds on US1 calculator but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after US1, no dependency on US2
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Independent of US2/US3, only needs US1 foundation
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start anytime after US1, affects all stories

### Within Each User Story

1. Tests MUST be written first and fail before implementation
2. Data models/services before UI components
3. Core implementation before integration
4. Each story complete and tested before next

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run simultaneously
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run simultaneously
- Unit tests within each story can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be developed by different team members
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 1 Setup - Launch all [P] tasks together:
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm init && npm install vite tailwindcss decimal.js --save

# Terminal 2  
npm install -D vitest playwright @playwright/test

# Terminal 3
Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml

# Terminal 4
Setup ESLint and Prettier configs
```

### User Story 1 Tests - Launch all unit tests together:
```bash
# Can run simultaneously as they test different modules
npm run test tests/unit/mortgageCalculator.test.js
npm run test tests/unit/validation.test.js  
npm run test tests/unit/currencyFormatter.test.js
```

### User Story 3 Implementation - Parallel model creation:
```bash
# Developer A
Create src/models/MortgageScenario.js

# Developer B  
Create src/models/ComparisonTable.js

# Developer C
Create src/services/scenarioManager.js
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test basic calculator independently
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages
6. Gather user feedback

### Incremental Delivery

1. Foundation + US1 ‚Üí Deploy MVP
2. Add US2 (Prepayments) ‚Üí Deploy Update 1
3. Add US3 (Comparison) ‚Üí Deploy Update 2
4. Add US4 + US5 ‚Üí Deploy Update 3
5. Polish ‚Üí Final Release

### Parallel Team Strategy (3 developers)

After Foundational phase:
- Developer A: User Story 1 + User Story 4
- Developer B: User Story 2 + User Story 5  
- Developer C: User Story 3 + Polish tasks
